Saint Michael the Archangel, The Right Hand of God, Supreme Commander and Prince of the Heavenly Host is the strongest, oldest, and wisest of the 4 Archangels, serving as God's (AO's) most loyal solider, his eldest son and the sole commander of his armies. Additionally his three daughters, banished from Heaven for trying to betray him and cursed, are the first three vampires cursed to crave human blood and, banished from Heaven and it's light, burning in daylight. They are still divine though and the curse accidentally takes some of that divinity when passed on, empowering new bearers and granting them immortality.
