Lichdragon Fortisax, God of Undeath and Rebirth was once the head of the Blue Draconic Lineage, birthed by [[Dragonlord Placidusax]] herself, but as time passed even her nigh-infinite lifespan drew towards it end, but she refused to die and instead transformed herself into the first Dracolich and in the process abandoning the Blue Draconic Lineage to form a new one, the Deathly Draconic Lineage formed of Dracoliches of various Lineages. This miraculous feat earned her the Dragonlord's respect, whom offered her a seat equal to her own below [[Archangel Michael]], which she graciously accepted. Fortisax's dragon form is that of scales turned black with rot, crackling with crimson lightning, though her human form is much less impressive, bearing a single pair of charcoal wings, jet black hair, and eyes filled with blood red electicity.
