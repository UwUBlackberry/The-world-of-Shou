 **Da Backstory**
 _Princess Artura Pendragon was a kind, excitable girl born to the royal Pendragon family, born from King Arthur’s wife’s affair with a noble. Due to this she was kept away from the prince and abused both physically and mentally, but she didn’t let this get her down. She knew she had to get away, and so in the night she left. It wasn’t long before the king hired someone to bring her back, but the Gosu whom he hired was a kindhearted man, and instead adopted Artura and told the king he couldn’t find her. With this adoption her last name became Kenshō, and as he began training her in the way of the Gosu her first name became Ganbatte. Eventually they parted ways for a time, Kenshō becoming hired muscle. Eventually she found herself hired by a runaway prince, reminding her of herself. This resemblance grew when she heard this prince’s name. Cosimo. Cosimo Pendragon, that is. She decided it would be better to keep this relation secret._
