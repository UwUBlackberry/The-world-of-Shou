The DIviners are a group chosen by [[The Void]] to act as it's eyes and ears in the other realms. When a person is facing a death they believe to be unjust they might be brought into The Void, if it deigns so. If the person is able to weather The Void they will become a Diviner, researching The Void and it's secrets. Even they are not immune to the effects though, and so when they become a Diviner they will have something taken from them, be it one of their senses or their ability to move certain parts of their body. A few days later [[The Voidling]] will come to explain the fledgingling Diviner's situation to them. A Diviner may only ascend to level 20 if the Void itself ordains it, claiming the throne and becoming sovereign over The Void.
